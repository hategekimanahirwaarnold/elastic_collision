# Collision of particles

This is a similation of physical collisions. Typically, this is elastic collision, which means that kinetic energy of particles won't be lost after collision.

This is an improvement over my other repository called "particles_collision", because this time I used matrix of rotation and a little bit more physics to calculate the angle particles will move to with respect to the angle they collided at.

Enjoy,
